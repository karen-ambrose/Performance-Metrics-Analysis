# Performance Metrics Analysis of FirstBank Mobile App

## Overview
This repository analyzes performance metrics of the FirstBank mobile app under simulated high-traffic conditions. Using JMeter, we modeled the actions of 100 customers interacting with the app simultaneously. The dataset was analyzed in Jupyter Notebook, and a comprehensive dashboard was created with Power BI for visualization.

## Contents
- `FBanalysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook featuring Python code for analyzing and visualizing the performance metrics data.
- `collated.csv`: A CSV file containing the dataset generated by JMeter simulations.
- Power BI Dashboard: An interactive dashboard summarizing key insights from the analysis.

## Dataset Details
The dataset, generated using JMeter, simulates high-traffic scenarios and includes:
- `Label`: Service category (e.g., Login, Airtime, Customer-Loan-Information).
- `No of Samples`: Observations for each service type.
- `Average_Resp_Time`: Mean response time (ms).
- `Min_Resp_Time` and `Max_Resp_Time`: Range of response times.
- `Std. Dev.`: Response time variability.
- `Error %`: Percentage of errors recorded.
- `Throughput`: Number of requests processed per second.
- `Received KB/sec` and `Sent KB/sec`: Data transfer rates.
- `Avg. Bytes`: Average bytes transmitted.

## Tools and Technologies
- **JMeter:** Simulating customer interactions with the mobile app.
- **Python and Jupyter Notebook:** For detailed analysis of performance metrics.
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboard creation to visualize trends and insights.

## Installation
To replicate the analysis, install Python and the following libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install the libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Key Insights
- **Highest Average Response Time:** 27,416 ms, suggesting potential bottlenecks in certain services.
- **Lowest Recorded Response Time:** 94 ms, indicating optimal performance for some transactions.
- **Average Throughput Across All Labels:** 4.42 requests per second, demonstrating the app's capacity to handle concurrent requests.
- **Error Rate:** Generally low at 0.90%, but consistent monitoring is advised to maintain reliability.
- **Throughput and Error Stability:** The scatter plot analysis indicates higher throughput correlates with lower error percentages, suggesting stable system performance under load.

- **Outlier Detection:** Analysis revealed 2 instances of 'Customer-Loan-Information' services as outliers, warranting further investigation.
